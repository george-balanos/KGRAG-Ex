   - The relationship is one of the predefined types and is semantically correct.
2. Only extract **forward relationships**.
   - ‚ùå Do NOT include reverse/inverse relationships (e.g., only include `Hypertension : Diseases : INCREASES_RISK_OF : Stroke : Diseases`, not the reverse).
3. Do not infer data that is not explicitly stated in the text.
4. Avoid duplicates and redundant triples.
5. If no valid triples exist, return nothing.

üì§ **Output Format:**
- One triple per line.
- **Must begin with**: `Answer:`
